I am an PhD Graduate in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) from University of Isfahan <a href="https://comp.ui.ac.ir/en">(UI)</a> where I conducted research in the ILS-Lab under the supervision of <a href="https://engold.ui.ac.ir/~adibi/"> Prof. Peyman Adibi</a> and <a href="https://engold.ui.ac.ir/~h.karshenas/"> Prof. Hossein Karshenas</a>  and the advisement of Prof. Mehrtash Harandi and Dr. Soumava Kumar Roy. My doctoral research concentrated on meta-learning on Riemannian spaces, leveraging the geometric structure (constraints) of the parameter's space for meta-learning. As the result, we developed a Riemannian (constrained) bilevel optimization method for model-agnostic meta-learning. A part of my PhD research was completed as a collaboration with Prof. Jocelyn Chanussot from the GIPSA-Lab (Grenoble Institute of Technology, Grenoble, France), where we developed a method that enforces orthogonality constraints on the parameters (and optimize them on the Stiefel manifold) to generate more stabe modulation parametrs for multi-modal meta-learning.

Previously, I have worked on various topics, including path plannig of mobile robots, deep learning and evolutionary computation.

My research interests include geometry-aware machine learning, Large Language Models (LLMs) and optimization methods to efficiently train them.
